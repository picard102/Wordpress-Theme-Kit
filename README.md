```
$ grunt dev
```

When you're activly working on a project and wish to continuously update the build files, seeing the changes in the browser as they are made, run the below command. You will need to have run the previous command before starting to ensure all the nessicary files are present. The following command will only update changed files.

```
$ grunt watch
```

To initiate a full build and a minor version bump run the below command. This will run more comprehensive linting options and remove development flags from your files. You'll usualy only run this durring deploy stages.

```
$ grunt build
```
